##  Introduction
This is my second task for the internship, and I coded it myself in Python.  
It’s a very simple calculator where you give two numbers and select an operation,
and it will instantly give you the answer.  
I made this to practice Python basics and make a small useful tool.

## Features
- Can do **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
- Works for both whole numbers and decimal numbers.
- Shows result quickly without any delay.
- If you enter a wrong operation, it tells you it’s invalid.

##  How It Works
1. The program asks for the first number.
2. Then it asks for the second number.
3. Next, it asks you to choose one operation from (+, -, *, /).
4. It calculates the answer based on your choice.
5. Finally, it prints the result.
